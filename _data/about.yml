We make beautiful products for iOS and Android from our hometown of Glasgow.<br><br>The founding team of Add Jam, Chris and Michael, met way back in Primary School and have grown up with a shared interest in technology. The team kicked off a 'working relationship' while at a Hackaton hosted by Amazon. The first product the team worked on, Travel Bit, was a contextual travel planner for iOS. <br><br>In early 2014 Add Jam were awarded a contract to work on Active Travel applications for the Â£24 million Technology Strategy Board Future City Project in Glasgow.
