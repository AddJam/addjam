overview: Founded in early 2014, Add Jam is an exciting mix of quality engineering talent, flair for design and a passion for Scotland to produce world class products that thousands of people around the world love. <br><br> Chris and Michael met way back in Primary School and have grown up with a shared interest in technology. Both eventually ending up studying in the same Computer Science department. Michael, graduating a few years before Chris, found his way into a Scottish tech startup called Dizeo, making a safe social network for children. Chris meanwhile continuted with studying and Michael returned to join him at the University of Strathclyde to study Product Development. <br><br> While here Michael and Chris kicked off a 'working relationship' while at a Hackaton hosted by Amazon. This first product, Travel Bit, was contextual travel planner which proved a solid introduction to the needs of tourists. <br><br>In early 2014 Add Jam were awarded a contract to work on Active Travel applications for the Technology Strategy Board Future City Project. This kick started Add Jam and throughout 2014 we developed a host of products and worked with other great organisations.
location: We are proudly based in Glasgow, Scotland. Home of Irn Bru and statues with traffic cones on their head. <br><br> We are active in our local community and love to support local initiatives such as Tech Meetup and, of course, our own RookieOven events.
