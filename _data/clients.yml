  description: <p>Add Jam delivered mobile applications in the Active Travel stream of the £24 million Technology Strategy Board funded Future City project. We developed Glasgow Walking for iOS and Android aimed at making information on city attractions accessible. </p><p>As little as 5% increase in activity from each citizen is estimated to save the NHS £60 million by reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and other avoidable illnesses. The Glasgow Walking app makes local heritage information easily accessible in the format of curated walks with the aim of getting citizens to tour their city and be more active.</p><p> The Glasgow Walking 'Admin area' acts as a single source for the citys heritage data and allows the council to update walks and push updates out to citizens and tourists. Therefore the information is easily kept up to date, relevant and useful.</p>
