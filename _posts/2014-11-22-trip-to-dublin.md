Last month the Add Jam team hd the pleasure of going to the Dublin Web Summit through our RookieOven Project.

The Web Summit is in its 4th year and is regarded as one of the biggest events in the European tech calendar. This year attendance was roughly 20,000 people over the three days. Here’s a round up of our thoughts:

##Inspiring People

There were some simply outstanding talks and chats on stage. Guys like Tony Fadell, founder of the excellent Nest, and Wayne Chang, founder of Crashlytics have created products that have had a huge impact on Add Jam and how we work and live.

To have these guys talking through their experiences and processes was invaluable. Seeing the people who have executed so well on products and business galvanises our belief that we can achieve similar levels of success.

##Getting Social

We’re fans of the informal get together - hence the RookieOven Meetups - and in Dublin these were taken to another level. One party we went to was joint sponsored by Facebook owned Parse and Twilio. Grabbing a pint of Guinness with Jeff Lawson and the gang was great but it was also a fantastic opportunity to meet founders from around the world. On the first night we spoke to Americans, Australians, Egyptians and of course a few locals. The diversity was great to see.

##Low level of exhibitors

As I mentioned the Web Summit has grown at a staggering pace and with there there have been some scaling issues. Take for instance the exhibitor spaces, there was double the amount of stalls as last year and also spread out over three days. This meant the general level of exhibitors was quite low - previously there was some sense of curation.

This led to us being pitched “Facebook for Dogs” (seriously) and the “solution to the reply all button” (we didn’t really know there was a problem here). These are edge cases but in general there were too many exhibitors with no validation, no business model and no clearly identified customer.

In all Chris and I had a great time in Dublin and would recommend going to Web Summit but perhaps not to exhibit.
