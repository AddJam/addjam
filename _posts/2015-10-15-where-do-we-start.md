Recently I spoke alongside Duncan Blair, Senior Product Manager at Fanduel, and Kate Ho, Head of Product at the Scottish Government, at ScotSoft 2015 Conference in Edinburgh. ScotSoft is the annual conference organised by ScotlandIS, the trade body for technology in Scotland. It was a big deal to be asked to speak at the event and an honour to share the stage with such prestigious and well known organisations. 

The session was in the format of a fireside chat, Kate chairing the session and asking questions to Duncan and I. Overall I felt it went pretty well and we covered some really interesting topics but I think I'm now kicking myself. 

##What is your starting point for a product?

I thought my answer to the question was quite profound and useful. I imagine most people would assume we start off by firing up our computers and launching into Sketch or Illustrator but I gave the answer pen and paper. 

I pointed out our starting off point is to sketch out ideas and concepts on paper before ever touching a computer. There's something more fluid about sketching out ideas - scoring out, writing notes and having a physical artifact all seem to make it a much easier way to share concepts and communicate.

But I was wrong.

##In a Fireside chat far far away

The Star Wars geek in my was reading up on the new movie, The Force Awakens, by JJ Abrams when I came across this great fireside chat with Abrams, Jonathan Ive, Apple's Chief Design Officer, and with Brian Grazer asking the questions. One of the questions put to Ive is about the incubation of an idea and at the lowest level how he and Steve Jobs would develop ideas into products. His answer is way more profound than mine. Conversation.

Ive points out that before even reaching for a pen your ideas start with words. Speaking about the idea is so important and comes first, you build things with words. But the process is more than just speaking, you also have to listen and be careful of small details or as Ive calls it the "quiet voice" which can often be shouted out by the "loud voice".

I highly advise watching the video. It's a good reminder that even the most innovative companies in the world start the product development journey in such a simple way. 

Words are our starting point for making all our products.
