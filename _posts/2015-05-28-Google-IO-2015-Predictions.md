Tonight we're hosting a Google I/O 1015 Extended event in our office. We're having a Keynote Livestream - we have the beers, we have cake and we have the screen setup. All we need now is the keynote to start.

##Mmmmmm... Android
Without doubt Google's biggest focu
s over the past few years has been Android and we think it will again have a big role to play in the I/O Keynote in the shape of the next flavour of Android - Android M. 

We're looking forward to seeing what it will bring but we don't expect changes as big as 'L' brought last year with material design and ART. We have read rumours suggesting iOS style of permission control.

We've never been fans of the Android all or nothing approach to permissions. It left users unaware of when data is being accessed and how and as developers you could be hand strung into declaring using a certain permission even although it might only be used in an little used feature. Gaining permission as users need it makes sense but what will happen if they say no?  It will be interesting to see how this is implemented and if it will cause headaches.

##PaaS
At the Dublin Web Summit last year Google were keen to push their PaaS offerings and we think there will be more of this at I/O. Infrastructure has always been one of Googles strengths.

In all honesty we don't currently have any of our services running on the Google infrastructure (we mainly use AWS and Digital Ocean and a few other providers where we see benefit) but its still interesting to see how they innovate and push the industry forward. 

We are big fans of Docker at Add Jam as are Google. They currently have Docker support on the Google Container Engine, could there be something else they will announce at I/O?

##Wearables
Without doubt we'll also hear about wearables. Apple Watch has seemingly managed to by the bucket load (we've seen a few now -'in the wild') where as the various Android wear devices haven't had the same impact.

Andorid Wear has one area is can really excel over Apple Watch and that's choice. With iPhone you can have a 5c, 5s, 6 or 6+ - the biggest iPhone range ever. That's still someway off the plethora of devices on the Android platform. Samsung along seemingly churn out a new device each week.

With so many manufacturers taking a stab at what they think a wearable should look like Android Wear has huge potential - if they get the software and experience right. Fingers crossed for something cool at I/O.

##Google X
2012 we had the spectaular arrival of Google Glass. I wonder if this year we will see Self Driving Cars come out of Google X. Or will it be something about the home - Tony Fadell and Nest have been very quiet. Perhaps it will be something autonomous that isnt a car - Boston Dynamics Big Dog for the home?

What do you expect of #io15 ? And where are you watching it? Feel free to join us in Glasgow - https://plus.google.com/events/cgri5qldjgem1aehs2d171813lcï»¿
