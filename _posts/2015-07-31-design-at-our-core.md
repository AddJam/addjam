Everything man made has been designed. From the desk in your office to the pens and paper on top of it. A conscious decision has been made that has given the object that purpose but also that look and feel. With design, looks matter. You don't want something that isn't aesthetically pleasing sitting on your desk and it's the same with software.

However design goes beyond the aesthetics. Steve Jobs has many great quotes attributed to him but one of the best is:

>"Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works."

At Add Jam we bring design into the core of the product development process. 

##Design is more than the aesthetics of a product.

We love our coffee. We've tried all kinds of coffee making contraptions from stove tops and cafetieres to V60's but nothing has made consistently good coffee as well as the Aeropress.

Which is surprising. The packaging looks like it was designed for TV infomercials with cheesy slogans, seemingly outrageous claims and a box that is an awkward hexagonal shape. When you go past the packaging and take the Aeropress out the box you're greeted with bits of smoked plastic that give a decidedly 80's feel that doesn't instill confidence. Then there's the various plastic accessories that are packed with the product - a funnel, an odd shaped spoon and a stubby stirrer. It's hardly the last word in simplicity.

But in truth, for making coffee - the product transcends its looks. Consistently you get a great coffee, smooth and with little to no sediment from the grind. It's really easy to clean and once you get a knack for how all the bits fit together it's actually pretty quick to make a wonderful coffee. As a product the Aeropress clearly shows design is about how it works.

##Designers are as important as engineers

We see companies like Stripe and Square doing amazingly well in traditional industries ruled by massive corporations. I think it's no coincidence that both these companies have a strong culture of design. Square famously pay their designers as well as technical staff/engineers which, at least at the time, was unheard of.

We strongly believe tech companies should be looking to embrace design as an invaluable skillset. And likewise individuals with the skills in designing excellent physical products should look at technology as another means to create products.

Likewise engineers should be viewed not just as technical staff but as key members of the product development team. Their skills and input will ultimately effect the end product.

##How software works

A common mantra in software development is users doesn't care how the product is created, they're only interested in the end product. This is true to a certain extent. I know my granny doesn't care if something is written in PHP or Ruby. However she will care if a product is unresponsive, unpredictable or takes too long to load.

Decisions on implementation *do* have an impact on the end product. They fundamentally have an impact on how our users experience our products. 

Design choices made in the initial technical planning of a product are very important. The decisions made on the product schema along with how and what you're storing will dictate what you can achieve at product level.

We can't stress highly enough; design really isn't something you sprinkle over the top of software, it's baked within and should never be an after thought.

##Transferable skills

In life we like to give things and people labels or put them into silos. So of course we often put software into it's own distinct bucket. In truth creating software shares a lot of the concepts and principles of creating products in other industries and vice versa.

When making a physical product you would look into material selection, distribution, a manufacturing process, suppliers and maintenance/after life. In software it's really not so different; we have language/stack selection, hosting, deployment, integrations/service providers and maintenance/readability.

I admit when you get down to the low level detail there are differences and area's in which you need expert knowledge but at a high level the processes and techniques used in the product development journey are so similar. What we do in software really is not unique.

##Design at the core

Add Jam put design at the forefront of our products and we build from the outset trying to achieve the best end user experience possible. 

Let's take the Glasgow Cycling product we delivered for the Future City Glasgow Project. One of the key objectives of the product was to produce a useful and simple way for cyclists in Glasgow to create data that would inform the council on their usage.

As locals we knew one thing you can be certain of in Glasgow is unpredictable weather. So we knew providing weather information to users would be a great addition to the product.

With this in mind we created the product from the outset to store hourly weather data that could be incorporated into the app in a subtle yet useful manner. In the end product you reveal the weather by scrolling beyond the bounds of the home screen. Further to this we are able to tie hourly usage data together with this weather data to provide useful information on how weather affects cycling in the city. This certainly would be something that would be more difficult to add in as an after thought.

Both Chris and I view ourselves as software product developers. We use design techniques and principles on all our projects. As we grow as a business we aim to maintain this way of working and be like Stripe and Square. We will continue to hold design in high regard. We strongly believe design is more than just what a product looks like.
