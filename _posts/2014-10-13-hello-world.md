title: Hello World. Hello Add Jam.
---

Today is a big day for the Add Jam team as we put live our glorious new site. Designed and built entirely in house, Chris and I will be sharing the process we went through to design the site and details on the stack we used for building it. These posts will be up in the coming weeks but for now let me give you a tour of the site.

Our homepage serves as an overview of our company. So firstly we introduce visitors to the most important aspect of Add Jam - our team. Chris and I give a somewhat lighthearted overview of ourselves and make it clear how people can get in touch with us personally via twitter or email.

Moving down the homepage we get to a section describing what we make and highlighting our skills and expertise in mobile design and development. We split this area into 3 distinct sections each with their own page:

* Products i.e. what we make
* Client case studies i.e. what we make in partnership with other organisations
* Open source i.e. how we contribute back to the community

Each section is important to Add Jam as a company. Our products define who we are and are important exemplars of our abilities. Client case studies show how we collaborate with other organisations, on this note we also have a ‘Hire us’ page with a contact form for people to submit proposals for projects we could partner on. The work of others on open source projects are the bedrock of Add Jam the likes of Rails, the work Mattt Thompson and many others helps us to deliver our great products and projects we’ve worked on so we are keen to give back. We open source libraries that we build for us that we think others will find useful.

Back to the Homepage and we conclude with a section that touches on our philosophy. We aim as a company to be transparent and share our facts and figures. For our products we include sign up numbers and active visitors on our real time dashboard. This dashboard is used by the team to have glanceable updates on our products throughout the day and we find it so useful we thought it would be a shame not to share it with others. As well as the dashbaord we will be as open as possible on our blog. We aim to post frequently on a range of topics - technical, marketing, design, thoughts and opinion - all with the intention of giving insight into our processes and our journey as a company.

And that’s us, Add Jam is out in the open now so I'll close by saying feel free to get in touch with either Chris or myself at any time.
