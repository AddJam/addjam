title: Getting Productive

Over the past year we've worked hard at finding services that complement our ways of working that are effective and most importantly stick. It's common knowledge that services can have all the functionality in the world but if they don't fit into a workflow or way of working it's wasted effort. Here's a summary of the key services we use as a team.

##[Slack](https://slack.com/r/0298upfq-02986d27 "Slack referral")

The number one tool for Add Jam without a doubt is the excellent Slack. I was skeptical at first, we had tried to adopt similar services in the past (gitter which integrates with Github was a good example) but Slack stuck.

###It's All About Communication

Slack is our central communications hub across the team and even externally. We hook up other services into this so we have visibility of deploys, tests, commits and more.

We have channels for each project or client as well as general channels for a particular workflow type (for example we have a design channel where we post inspiration and concepts, and an iOS Development channel for sharing new libraries and guides).

###It's Also About The People

Slack allows us to invite external collaborators and clients into our channels. So on a client by client basis we can create channels relevant to them and segmented from the rest of the Add Jam internal noise.

These channels are then hooked up to other services giving clients the same visibility on the project as the Add Jam team.  

##[Github](https://github.com "GitHub homepage")

Remote repositories right? Well yeah, but it's also so much more. 

###Social Coding

Without doubt Github is essential for our open source projects. The social aspect allows us to make pull requests or have them done on our code. Most developers will have at least a free account and can join in with us.

The social aspect of the service also allows us to find interesting new projects and libraries via the 'trending' section and emails. Plus we follow our favourite developers and friends in other organisations so it gives us insight into how they work.

###Hosting more than code

We also use Github pages to host simple single page projects where applicable (see LoL2048). It's free and robust, being on the GitHub infrastructure allowed us to handle the massive traffic LoL2048 received on day one. Important when you consider LoL2048 had no means of generating money.

Another really handy feature we use on Github is Wiki's. For Add Jam a Github Wiki serves as an internal knowledge base. Here we keep a log of devices available to Add Jam, services we use and why, a reading list and a place to keep company copy and logos. All basic information but to have it centralised and accessible is really valuable to the team as is (Chris and I) but will become even more useful as Add Jam expands.

##[Trello](http://trello.com "Trello homepage")

Project Management tools are two a penny and so many organisations have a preference for their own service. We find Trello the best for Add Jam.

It's free, easy to understand, has a mobile client and integrates with Slack. Most importantly the Kanban style of moving cards suits our workflow.

###Get Things Done

We have project level boards for each project (client or internal product). This is hooked up to the relevant Slack channel and gives visibility across the organisation of when task are completed.

This also gives contributors and clients 

###Getting Things Planned

We also have a company level 'Master Board'. This is without doubt the most useful board for Add Jam as a young business.

Here we list goals and tasks for 'This Week', 'This Month', '6 Months' and '12 Months'. We always want to see progression of tasks that will help us reach those 12 month goals.

We also have an 'Icebox' where we stick ideas and projects that would be good to do \*someday\*. This layout allows us to say 'no' and keep focus on what's important, what is on the board.

##[Dropbox](http://dropbox.com dropbox "homepage")

It's the best in the game at the moment. We have Google Drive, One Drive, iCloud Drive and Box accounts but Dropbox just 'fits' for Add Jam.

###Little Used But Useful

We don't sync much through it internally (we try to share important and finalised files through Slack) but it's handy for three main areas of work:

* Sharing work-in-progress files - things like Sketch Designs are best shared through Dropbox and saves a versioning mess and email ping pong.
* Sharing Paw files - we use the incredibly useful Paw for testing endpoints and making requests. Dropbox is the best way to keep these constantly changing paw files.
* Piece of mind - Dropbox is robust so we use it as a means of backing up assets and files not in Github.

###Popular & Accessible
There's no denying Dropbox is popular (apparently well in excess of 300 million users no less). With this popularity comes familiarity for our clients. With this in mind Dropbox is by far the easiest way to share files and assets with the few clients who aren't in a Slack channel.

##Summary

Our biggest piece of advice is do what works for you - experiment and give it a shot. But also it should be no surprise the services we use are market leaders and well established in their fields. What works for you will likely also work for others.

With that in mind, hopefully the above will shine some light on how Add Jam works and help improve your work flow.
