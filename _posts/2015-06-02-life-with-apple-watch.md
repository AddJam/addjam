19th of April 2015, the Add Jam team kick the day off camped out at their laptops to order the Apple Watch. Success! Two 42mm Stainless Steel Apple Watches ordered for the opening delivery window.

Delivered at the end of April, we've now had our devices for a over a month. Here's how we've found life with the Apple Watch.

##Checking in

One of the most evident benefits of Apple Watch is having Passbook on your wrist. It was fitting then that two days after the delivery of our Apple Watches both Chris and I set off on short breaks. Chris to London and myself to Rome. 

We both had different experiences using our watches for Passbook. I found myself too ashamed to use the watch, the newness of the form factor made me self conscious. Chris on the other hand, being the braver of us, proudly put faith in his watch and used it for getting through security.

He did however hit a stumbling block when it came to boarding. Firstly the scanner at the gate was was behind a counter but the biggest deal breaker was the design. It had a cover over the top meaning not even Chris' skinny wrists could fit under it. 

##Getting around

Initially the concept of maps on your wrist was wasted on me. Surely nobody would want to use a postage stamp size screen on their wrist to scroll around a map when they have their phone on them. How wrong I was. I didn't understand the true use case.

Apple Watch Maps came in super useful while on my break to Rome. I found navigating the tight cobbled streets of the city to be a breeze with maps on Apple Watch. Setting a destination on my phone I was given a gentle tap when I came to a turn and a nice big, easy to understand arrow on my wrist. I'm now an Apple Watch navigation convert.

Maps isn't for browsing, it's for getting you places.

##Being a typical Scot

One thing Scottish people will always talk about is weather. Its understandable really, in Glasgow we can easily have 4 seasons in an hour let alone a day. So having weather information displayed on my watch face, using what Apple call a complication, is massively useful.

Taking it a step further, I have the amazingly accurate Dark Sky on my Apple Watch. The app has a Glance - these are quickly accessible signle screens with information, accessed with a swipe up on the watch face. In a common fault with all Glances, it takes so long for the little information it displays to load I'm usually quicker firing up the app.

The Dark Sky app is gorgeous. There's a nice animation at the top of the main screen depicting the weather and detailed information accessible with a scroll of the digital crown. The granular weather data is as spot on as ever and really at home on the wrist.

##Being active

We're busy and largely inactive people. It's part of the job of being the founder of a tech startup. We're typically sat infront of our MacBooks for hours on end each day.

The hourly reminders to try stand at least once an hour have been beneficial on a few levels. Firstly I do believe it will have a positive impact on my health but Chris and I are also using it as a way to once an hour get up and away from the code. We talk about our problems and plans. We even use it as an excuse to fit in a game of pool.

It breaks up the day, gets us out our own heads and I think has a beneficial impact on productivity.

##Communication

The Apple Watch comes packed with a multitude of means to communicate. Sketch, taps and heartbeats have been demoed repeatedly but none of them are of much genuine use.

Instead I've found one of Apple's biggest let downs in the past few years to excel on Apple Watch - Siri. Dictation and voice recognition (even with our Glaswegian accents) has been near flawless. A far cry from the Siri of 2011.

With dictation being so accurate I've found myself dictating messages quite often on my watch whereas on iPhone and iPad it's a feature I've never used.

##In Summary

The Apple Watch is a gorgeous bit of modern technology. In our stainless steel models the construction and materials used are flawless. The unit is solid and the digital crown has an excellent feel to it, especially when paired with the taptics.

The software is nice and easy enough to use but in all fairness does feel very much like a V1. This means there's plenty of scope for Apple to improve and I'm sure it will improve massively in time - especially with WWDC just round the corner.

Overall if I lost the Apple Watch today I'm not sure I would run out to buy another one but I do feel there is a lot of potential in the platform and I look forward to seeing where Apple and Google with Android Wear take wrist worn wearables.
