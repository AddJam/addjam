title: A Year of Add Jam
description: A review of our first year in business as Add Jam. From Future City Glasgow to the exciting RookieOven developments for 2015.

Going from full time employment to founding Add Jam, the past year has been amazing for Michael and I. This is our story.

##Starting Out

At the end of 2013 and beginning of 2014, Michael and I were spending more and more of our time working on our own projects. We were both in full time employment; Michael at Strathclyde University and me at Kana. Our days became more and more of 9 to 5 at our jobs, 6:30 to late working on our own projects. Our own projects were what drove us, and while our jobs weren't bad ones, they were getting in the way. We couldn't spend enough time on our projects or on learning things relevant to what we love - creating mobile products.

We wanted to get to a point where we could be working on our own products full time, but we couldn't just stop earning money. We didn't want to look for investment or grants for a product, so the clear solution for us was in client work. Working on client projects creating mobile apps would let us spend our days on relevant learning, and wouldn't tie us down to a full-time permanent job.

With this in mind, we started talking to Scott Sherwood about joining Glasgow's Future City Project. They needed developers to work on Active Travel apps, and our project at the time was an intelligent travel guide for iOS we were calling Scout. The idea behind Scout was that you'd tell it where you're travelling to and it would tell you what you need to know to prepare. We showed off Scout in our pitch to the Future City Project, and ultimately earned our first contract.

##Executing

The Future City Project became our biggest project of 2014 and our main source of income. We created two products there; Glasgow Walking and Glasgow Cycling (you can read more about these on our [Client Case Studies section](/client-case-studies/ "Add Jam Client Projects")). These products each had a Ruby on Rails backend and native iOS and Android apps, but were more than just six code bases. We crafted the entire UX of the products as well as most of the UI. We learned a ton from this project, and applied that to everything else we worked on.

Throughout that project and the other client projects we picked up in 2014, we continued our drive towards earning money from our own products. We both strongly believe the products we create should be something we're passioante about and something we need. If we create a product neither of us would use, how can we know it's good? Our target niche became esports - an area I'm passionate about. I love to follow the League of Legends professional scene, so we started there.

We created the [League of Legends Newsletter](http://lolnewsletter.com) as an easy way to keep up with the game - we love newsletters like [Hacker Newsletter](http://hackernewsletter.com/) and [iOS Dev Weekly](http://iosdevweekly.com/) and I seen a need for something similar. The newsletter is growing consistently and is now at nearly 2000 subscribers.

We also created [LoL2048](http://lol2048.com), a themed version of the open source 2048 game by Gabriele Cirulli that took up everyones time in March and April. LoL2048 quickly seen amazing success - we spent 30 minutes theming 2048 and were sitting on the edge of our seats for the rest of the day, peaking at over 7000 concurrent users within hours of posting on the League of Legends subreddit. The game has now been played 17.6 million times by 1.3 million people, and we've used it to feed the growth of our newsletter. One of the coolest parts of this was seeing pro players and hosts tweeting about it.

We've experimented with a number of other ways to grow the newsletter, some of which were successful and others not. This is representative of the whole year for Add Jam - we had successes, we made mistakes, we applied what we learned from those to the next product and improved drastically over the year. We weren't perfect, but progressing was far more important than being afraid of failure.

##Another Year

This year we move into our offices - Michael has been working on establishing a better tech community in Glasgow for years and the next step is the [RookieOven](http://rookieoven.com) coworking space pictured above. We'll be moving there in just a couple of weeks with some amazing startups around us. Being surrounded by these startups will be a driving force to creating better products and learning more than ever.

Add Jam will keep working on client products, and keep moving towards earning more from our own products. Going forward we want to work with clients on products that excite us and give us the freedom we need to really show off our product development skills. We'd love to talk with you if you have a product we can work with you on.

Lastly, we're keen to help others. We know how tough it is to get started and some of the challenges people face in their first year. If there's any way we can help or anything you would like us to expand on in our blog then [get in touch](mailto:yo@addjam.com "Hire Add Jam").
