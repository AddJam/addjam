Starting your own business is daunting. One of the biggest concerns a founder has is how to fund it all. Even today with $5 per month Digital Ocean VPS, free fast Internet access and amazing open source tools and frameworks all giving a ridiculously low barrier to entry you still have costs and you still need to live.

So how do you do it? How do you cut the cord and start a business? While by no means experts we thought it would be worth sharing the Add Jam approach to this.

##Hand outs and the like

At least locally in Glasgow/Scotland local and national government supports young businesses through a raft of schemes and programmes - Business Gateway, Scottish Enterprise, Interactive Scotland, Creative Clyde etc etc.

The help comes in a lot of shapes, sizes and... quality. Some of it is outstanding like EIE by Informatics Ventures, others are, to be blunt, not so good. 

One of the forms of help available to Scottish based businesses is grants. Grants have been put to us as 'free money' (incredibly by those 'giving' it out) but we don't agree with this approach. It's not free money. It's tax payers money. We see so many startups where the founders are basically full time grant application writers - no sales, no product development. In our eyes it isn't a business.

Grants lack a 'commercial' edge and for us leave a bad taste in the mouth.Match funding, favorable loans and salary contributions are better as there's some onus on the company to pay something. However even this type of public support often has barriers and dense paperwork before being able to access it. Then when you do there can be clauses and exceptions which affect how you use the support. This can hinder your business rather than helping it.

##To raise, or not to raise

Investment is of course an option. For this you effectively sell a portion of your business. You then aim to use the new capital to increase the value of what you retain (and the portion now owned by the investor).

Investment is totally viable and there is an active investment community in Scotland. Events such as EIE and Venturefest put young businesses in contact with investors and give them an opportunity to start a conversation about investment.

While viable, investment is not for everyone and when you do seek investment you need to ensure it is at the right time and is the right thing to do.

With investors comes another voice (which can be both good and bad) and an external pressure to perform on whatever key metric is deemed important for success (sometimes this isn't revenue) which might not sit with your ethos.

##Bootstrapping

Bootstrap is how Add Jam goes about business. We work with several partner organisations to develop products on their behalf. We use our skills and abilities to generate revenue that allows us to develop products in our own manner.

It gives us freedom to work on what we want to work on and in a manner that suits the team. Yeah it means we work crazy hours and our speed when developing products is hindered but don't have external pressures and aren't tied into some performance framework. It allows us to have the company and culture that we want.

This is an approach shared by our peers in the RookieOven Co-working space such as Insurance By Jack and FarmGeek. Above I've embedded a great video from 2010. In it race car driver and founder of Basecamp David Heinemeier Hansson fights his corner with Jason Calacanis over how to fund and grow a tech business from revenues. It's a must watch.

While it often feels like a double workload and our progress on product is hampered by a need to generate our own revenue we wouldn't do it any other way at this stage.

##Summary

In the end it's a case of each to their own. Some businesses will need investment at an early stage, others you can bootstrap with very little resource.

There's no right or wrong way to do it but we hope that by sharing our mantra it shows it is definitely possible to bootstrap your products in Scotland.
