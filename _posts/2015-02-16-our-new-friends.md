We are passionate about our local tech community. Glasgow is an amazing city with an astonishing history of innovation but we feel recently the city has lost its way in regards to tech. But that's all going to change with the new RookieOven coworking space.

The space is in the stunning [Fairfield Shipyard in Govan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfield_Offices). Once the [biggest shipyard on the Clyde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfield_Shipbuilding_and_Engineering_Company) and the heart of the Glasgow shipbuilding industry. The very building we will be in was once the drawing offices and a hub of Victorian innovation. It's all coming full circle with our new friends:

##Rawtech

Founded by photographer extraordinaire Ashley Baxter. Insurance By Jack aim to bring personality and human speak to a boring and complex industry - business insurance.

Ashley does this with weekly Q&A's, indepth case studies and excellent content on the Insurance By Jack blog. The blog is full of insight into her experiments and trials as she grows her business.

Bringing modern technology to farms is a huge opportunity and John is killing it with Farm Geek. The product lets farmers track assets and livestock through their lifetime. The data collection and potential for analytics and visualisation is of huge value to farmers.

##[Lighthouse Labs](http://lighthouselabs.co.uk)
{% image src:"/images/blog/lighthouse.png" alt:"Lighthouse" title:"Lighthouse labs iBeacon" %}

Location aware apps are nothing new - Dodgeball (the predecessor to Foursquare) started in 2000 - but iBeacons, they're something new and very powerful both for us users and for companies.

Fine grain indoor positioning has huge potential, wether that be speeding up the ordering/collection process at store when doing click and collect or when it comes to finding children lost in a shopping centre.

Lighthouse are developing a platform to empower developers to take full advantage of iBeacons. The team are split between London and Glasgow with Daniel McAfferty being base in the office with us.

There's more desk space available and if you're interested in joining the community get in touch with me (either [email](mailto:michael@addjam.com) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/_mdhayes) are best) and I can show you round some time.

We'll write up some more about the space and how it develops in the coming months. It's really something made by the community, for the community to make Glasgow a better place to base your tech business. It's going to need steer for you guys.
