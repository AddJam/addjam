Add Jam are joining the 2015/2016 Cross Creative Programme ran by [TRC Media](http://trcmedia.org). I'm taking part in the 6 month long programme of training sessions which includes a field trip to San Francisco in March 2016 to see first hand some of the most innovative companies in the world.

Tuesday this week was my first day on the programme and introduced me to my peers in this years Cross Creative cohort. Something both Chris and I strongly believe is that in most thing's "it's all about the people". Having the right people in business is hugely important in everything you do and impacts what you can achieve. In the Cross Creative cohort I don't think TRC could have picked a better group.

There's a fantastic line up of talent involved in the programme, with key staff from small startups like Add Jam to more established companies such as Axis Animation and Soluis. The cohort also has such diversity with the companies working in mobile to cutting edge tech like Virtual Reality.

So with our mantra of it's all about the people, it makes sense to give them a bit of an introduction.

##Jon-Paul Kitching - BetBux

Jon-Paul is the founder of BetBux, a startup looking to revolutionise the betting world by becoming the go-to, casual betting app that bridges the gap between traditional betting houses and social gaming.  Previously Jon-Paul founded the independent award winning music lifestyle brand CLASH. In doing so he worked with a long list of clients with the likes of Nike, Adidas, Red Bull, Sonos, Levis, All Saints and loads more.

BetBux is a different type of startup to Add Jam in that Jon-Paul with need more capital to operate. I like the diversity Cross Creative as it will push and question us with our approach to Add Jam.

##Andrew Dobbie - [MadeBrave](http://madebrave.com)

{% image src:"/images/blog/madebrave.png" alt:"Made Brave Logo" title:"Made Brave" %}

MadeBrave® is a full service digital creative agency based in Glasgow. Andrew founded MadeBrave in 2012 with a new born baby at home and £1000 of personal cash in the bank. Now in 2015 MadeBrave have a great team of folks based out of Bridgeton and work with huge clients across the UK.

I love to hear stories of bootstrapped businesses grown out of talent and perseverance. Our vision for Add Jam is to show it's possible to grow a tech business organically in Glasgow - that doesn't mean we don't have ambition or want to work at scale. It just means we want to do it in a sustainable way.

##Greg Williamson - [Soluis](http://soluis.com)

{% image src:"/images/blog/soluis.png" alt:"Soluis Group" title:"Soluis" %}

Soluis provide images, animations, films, applications, Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality experiences and solutions for our clients around the world. Greg was previously co-founder and Managing Director of 3D visualisation studio ‘Inlightin Ltd’ and joined Soluis in a company merger in 2014.

The work Soluis does is in a hugely exciting industry. Big names like Google, Valve, Microsoft, Facebook and Samsung are all releasing AR and VR devices and Soluis are at the forefront of creating content for these new device types.

##Anne Ward - [Newspaper Club](http://newspaperclub.com)

{% image src:"/images/blog/newspaper-club.png" alt:"Newspaper Club" title:"Newspaper Club" %}

Newspaper Club makes designing and printing a newspaper easier for everyone by providing free online layout software, templates and guides for a quick start. Flexible printing options means customers can print anything from 1 copy to 1 million and they can be shipped worldwide. Founded in 2009, Newspaper Club has to date printed 10 million newspapers.

I feel a lot of the work Newspaper Club is very closely aligned to what Add Jam are working on at the moment. If nothing else Cross Creative has given ourselves and Newspaper Club an opportunity to connect we otherwise might not have had.

##Gordan Langford - [Screenmedia](http://screenmedia.co.uk)

{% image src:"/images/blog/screenmedia.png" alt:"Screenmedia" title:"Screenmedia logo" %}

Screenmedia produce mobile apps as well as making websites and working with hardware devices such as Smart home controllers. Specialise in Xamarin development, quite different to how Add Jam goes about delivering mobile products.

Screenmedia boast a great portfolio of clients including The BBC, Channel4, RBS, the NHS, Honeywell, Howden to name a few. Screenmedia work in South Block in the city centre and are active in the local tech community which I love to see. They particularly support the mobile development meetup in the city.


##Debbie Ross - [Axis Animation](http://axisanimation.com)

{% image src:"/images/blog/axis-animation.png" alt:"Axis Animation halo and logo" title:"Axis Animation" %}

Founded in 2000, Axis is an award-winning, international studio of directors, designers, artists, animators, writers and producers. Axis create content across video games, film, television, commercials and online entertainment.
The Axis showreel is outstanding some of the biggest name sin videos games are there - Halo, League of Legends, Alien Isolation, Dead Island and Killzone all make an appearance.

It's amazing that a company producing such high quality content for huge names is just up the road from our office.

##The Programme

Cross Creative obviously includes the field trip to San Francisco but aside from that it also provides several high quality days of training for founders. The aim of Cross Creative is for those taking part to emerge better informed, re-energised, more ambitious, more confident, more reflective, and more determined than ever to succeed.

The cohort will next be meeting in November to study local case studies of high performing technology companies and then in December the cohort will be taking part in a workshop focused on negotiating skills.

These sessions will be highly valuable to Add Jam as we continue our product development of Mail Oven and incubate other product ideas over the coming months (and beyond).

##The Fieldtrip

We go to San Francisco in March next year. The aim of the field trip being to give us first hand exposure to some of the biggest and most innovative companies in the bay area such as Facebook, Github and Sony. On Tuesday Cross Creative Alumni Grant Dickson from Equator was there to show us his experience and how he has managed to put his learning into practice.

It really excites me to think what Add Jam can learn from the experience next March and what it will do for us through 2016.
