	<h2>Making Glasgow a more active city</h2>
	<p>Add Jam delivered mobile applications for the Active Travel
  stream of the £24 million Innovate UK funded Future City project
  in Glasgow. We developed Glasgow Walking for iOS and Android aimed
  at making information on city attractions accessible which in turn
  would encourage visitors and citizens to get up and explore our
  beautiful home city.</p>

	<p>As little as 5% increase in activity from each citizen is estimated
   to save the NHS £60 million by reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes,
   heart disease and other avoidable illnesses. The Glasgow Walking app
   makes local heritage information easily accessible in the format of
   curated walks with the aim of getting citizens to tour their city
   and be more active.</p>

  <p>The product allows Glasgow City Council to quickly produce mobile apps
  aimed at providing information for citizens in a cost effective manner. Apps
  for both Android and iOS can have data curated on the Glasgow Walking admin
  and accompanying mobile apps can be quickly reskinned to suit the branding
  of a given need.</p>

  <p>The Glasgow Walking 'Admin area' acts as a centralised single source
  for the curated heritage information for the city. The council is able
  to update walks and push updates out to citizens and tourists through
  the clean and easy to use web interface.</p>

  <p>The power of this admin area is in getting information up to date,
  relevant and useful. In a fast paced modern city such as Glasgow new
  attractions and activities open on a regular basis.</p>

  <p>The admin area has been used throughout the council and by key
  stakeholders in local community groups</p>

      <h3>Native apps for a cohesive experience</h3>

<div class="section">
  <p>Add Jam led product development on Glasgow Walking with the of to
  achieving a first class experience on mobile. We believe the experience
  delivered could only be achieved through native apps for each platform.</p>

  <p>On both platforms we have smooth scrolling of our lists which also include
  a compass for each item. This smoothly points in the direction of each listed
  attraction. Giving useful and subtle feedback to the user to create a rich user
  experience</p>

  <p>The apps are highly tailored to each platform to ensure they have a look and feel
  end users will find familiar. So for example on iOS we make use of 'Blur Views'
  which are in keeping with the look and feel for iOS introduced with iOS7.
  On Android   we use a styled dialog modal to display the same information
  as is the norm on Android.</p>
