	<h2>Making Glasgow a Cycling city</h2>
  <p>The overall aim with the Active Travel Demonstrator in the Future City
  Project is to develop ways a city can be less reliant on carbon based transit.
  So ideally by improving the amount of running, cycling and walking. This is
  an important area for the public sector for several reasons such as
  health, environment and the commuters bug bear congestion.</p>

  <p>For cycling Glasgow currently uses a study carried out over two days in
  September. The study is conducted the old fashioned and labour intensive way
  with counters and clipboards. This is then used as a basis for planning
  infrastructure and tracking cycle adoption in the city. Two days.
  In autumn. With clipboards. We can surely do better with software right?</p>

  <p>With the power of modern smartphones we have a plethora of options for
  tracking our activity and performance from the likes of Strava, MapMyRide
  and others but the problem with these services is the data is provided to a
  private company (usually to sell it directly or to advertisers). So the
  opportunity here is to make a useful tracker that exposes this data to folks
  that can really effect change in your area - the council. After all, they do
  provide the infrastructure.</p>

  <p>At Add Jam we believe in the Lean Startup methodology and mindset.
  We aim to get feedback and data from what we call a 30% product. Why? Well
  would you not rather have wasted 4 weeks making a 30% product than 4 months
  on a 100% product?</p>

  <p>With this ethos, a stack of assumptions, and some initial requirements
  gathering, we created an API (using Ruby on Rails) and an iOS app to track,
  search and find routes in 4 weeks. Sure, V1 certainly wasn't pretty, but it
  was functional.</p>

  <p>It was an invaluable step. It allowed us to learn - live from users and
  stakeholders in the council. We found issues with the data we were gathering,
  we found bottle necks in performance, we streamlined the route tracking UI
  and we improved the product immeasurably.</p>

<div class="case-detail">
  <p>Add Jam worked closely with the Active Travel lead, Mark Irwin, to
  identify the user groups the app should be engaging. Mark was fast to
  identify the typical end users of similar products as middle aged men,
  head to toe in lycra, tearing down the road in an attempt to become king of
  the mountain. These cyclists and the 'type' of cycling they undertake is a
  drop in the ocean compared to the potential volume of cycling across a city's
  population - commuters, families, couriers, tourists etc etc.</p>

  <p>With this in mind the interface for Glasgow Cycling had to be clean simple
  and streamlined. Using the working prototype and both qualitative and
  quantitative (analytics are essential) feedback we came to the final V2
  design.</p>

  <p>Starting a route? Easy. Big clear button in the middle and you start
  recording instantly. The profile page is clean, giving a general overview of
  'you' and the ability to navigate. Our favourite aspect of this view is the
  pull-down weather 'Easter Egg' - an essential for Glasgows predictably
  unpredictable weather.</p>

      <h3>Making data useful</h3>
    </div>
  </div>

<div class="case-detail">

  <p>The app empowers the cycling population of Glasgow to collect very
  powerful data. Data is great but what we really need to do is turn it into
  information - i.e. data with meaning. Our first step in this was to expose
  API endpoints so that developers can access the data and build additional
  services off the data. This fits with the ethos of the Open Glasgow Project
  we were working alongside.</p>

  <p>Our next call was to develop a simple dashboard (very much a V1 just now).
  This visualises simple city statistics and means the city (the city being
  citizens, businesses and the council) can easily consume the information on
  how the city is performing.</p>

  <p>With our relationship with Glasgow City Council being on going we hope to
  improve the dashboard and find new useful ways to expose the data. For
  example we think a CSV export would empower Excel users to cut and slice the
  data.</p>
