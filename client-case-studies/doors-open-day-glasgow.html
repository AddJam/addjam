  streets, parks, architecture, history and people with a programme full of

  <p>The app is on iPhones and includes information such as opening and closing
  times, on site ammenities for each attraction and detailed information on the
  history of each building.</p>

  <p>The app is a native iOS app and uses local storage to ensure participants
  in Doors Open Day can enage with the app even in the most remote parts of the city
  or deepest bunkers.</p>

  <p>The app borrows UI elements from Glasgow Walking such as the compass on lists
  and exentisve use of Blur views. The app was however heavily customised to suit
  the needs of Glasgow Building Preservation Trust</p>
