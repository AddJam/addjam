  Project. through development an opportunity came up to transform the
  existing Glasgow Walking app into a information app for the annual

  streets, parks, architecture, history and people with a programme full of
  walks, tours, talks, events and more than 100 buildings open for anyone to

  <p>The Doors Open Day Glasgow app includes information such as opening and closing
  times, on site amenities for each attraction and detailed information on the
  history of each building.</p>

  <p>The app is a native iOS app and uses local storage to ensure participants
  in Doors Open Day can engage with the app even in the most remote parts of the city
  or deepest bunkers.</p>

  <p>Being based on the Glasgow Walking code base, both the web and mobile
  portions of Doors Open Day Glasgow borrows many UI elements from Glasgow
  Walking. Examples of this is such as the compass on lists and extensive use
  of Blur views. The Doors Open Day Glasgow app was however heavily customised
  to suit the needs of Glasgow Building Preservation Trust.</p>
