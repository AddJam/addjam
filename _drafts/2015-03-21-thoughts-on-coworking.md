Add Jam recently moved into the RookieOven coworking space - the first dedicated coworking space in Glasgow for young tech businesses. RookieOven is based in the gorgeous Fairfield Shipyard Offices in Govan. Built in 1888 to service one of the biggest and most successful shipyards in the world the building is utterly stunning and after undergoing a Â£6 million restoration is the perfect home for Glasgows tech community. 

Although we haven't been in space for long we thought it would be worthwhile summarising our experiences so far.

##Huge Benefits

Its safe to say joining the coworking space and working in this environment has been transformational for Add Jam.

Working on a daily basis with some of the most talented design, development and marketing talent in the city has pushed us further and opened our eyes to new ways of thinking and working.

Take for example John Hamelink of FarmGeek. As businesses we share a similar stack for web development in Ruby on Rails and with an Ember front end. We talk openly about development practices and tools used in the product development process. Learning from John has improved how Add Jam as a team work.

The space has also played host to several events like Growth Glasgow. These have brought in tech talent and  interesting businesses into the space. This gives Add Jam direct contact with potential clients, partners and talent. A hug benefit alone.

Most recently Growth Glasgow gave us a platform to share some of our learnings from lol2048. 

##Creating Value For Others

I've think it's important not to be selfish. That means giving back to our peers around us. It can be something simple like taking 5 mins to proof read  some content or it takes the form of 30 mins sitting down to help someone work through a problem. 

It does takes time but on the whole a worthwhile experience. Firstly it allows us to observe others and learn from having a peek at their ways of working and processes. Secondly, sharing knowledge with our peers is an embodiment of the famous Einstein quote, "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough". It helps us up our game.

We've also been acting as accountability buddies for our peers. When Ashley, founder of Insurance By Jack, recently launched a web based photography course we would ask for stats updates and progress reports. In formally ensuring steady progess. We know when we launch products those around us will be just as keen to ensure our success.

##There's more still to come

It's early days for RookieOven. When we moved in day one there was only the homemade desks and cobbled together chairs. In the short time we've been here the space has grown an astonishing amount. 

We now have tables made of fire doors, games consoles, TV's, Sonos, bean bags, pub style pool table and a fridge packed with beer. All the things you would expect from a tech coworking space but most importantly it's the people we have alongside us. From 5 to 16 in a such a short period of time and all of them working in diverse areas with differing backgrounds and talents.

We have expert Python developers, developers specialising in location based app, some of the best rubyist in Scotland, a world class photographer and more in our little office. It's amazing each day to be exposed to such diversity.

In having such diversity is hugely beneficial to Add Jam and it's exciting to think the space is just over 30% capacity.

##Get involved

There are big plans for this community we're part of. We want this to become a key resource for the local tech community and something that puts Glasgow on the map as a producer of tech products and talent.

To get involved in the coworking space, host an event in it or to make use of it in another way drop Michael a message.
