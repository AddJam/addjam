A month ago we moved into the gorgeous Fairfield Shipyard Offices in Govan. Or more specifically the RookieOven coworking space - the first dedicated coworking space for young tech businesses in Glasgow.

To celebrate our first month we thought it would be worthwhile to summarise our experience in the space so far.

##Huge Benefits

Its safe to say working in this environment has been transformational for Add Jam.

Working on a daily basis with some of the most talented design, development and marketing talent in the city has pushed us further and opened our eyes to new ways of thinking and working.

Take for example John Hamelink of FarmGeek. Talking openly about development practices and tools used Add Jam have put in place several changes to make us work better as a team.


##Creating Value For Others

We've found it important not to be selfish. That means giving back to our peers around us. It can be something simple like taking 5 mins to proof read  some content or it takes the form of 30 mins sitting down to help someone work through a problem. 

It does takes time but on the whole a worthwhile experience.

##What's still to come

There's big plans for the community we're part of. We want this to become a key resource for the local tech community and something that puts Glasgow on the map as a producer of tech products and talent.

##How to get involved
