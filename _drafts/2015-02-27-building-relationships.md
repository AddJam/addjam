I recently received an email out the blue pitching Add Jam for an internship. That's cool, it's something we somewhat encourage with our footer 'Join Us' link, but is a cold email an effective way to get a job? Or for that matter inquiring about work? Or is a cold pitch for investment effective?

I don't think it is. Business is built on relationships.

##Where to Start

My response to the internship inquiry is copied above. I truly believe taking the time to establish and build relationships is more important than sending emails out en-mass. But it sure isn't easy to do it, so where do you start?

Meetups (such as the monthly RookieOven event Add Jam organise in Glasgow) have been the best place for the team to meet employers, talent, investors, clients and peers. All leading to important and indispensable business and personal relationships.

I understand there are a few barriers to getting along to such events. For me the main one is time. It's hella time consuming to attend your typical networking events (regardless of if it's in normal working hours or in the evening). You've no doubt got the usual daily grind and a personal life to maintain but I can't stress enough how valuable these events can be - make time for them.

Another massive barrier can be fear. These networking events can seem impenetrable. A close, tightly knit niche of people and you know nobody. In my experience I've never attended a meetup and not left with at least one new acquaintance. In general the people at networking events are there to do one thing... network. They're going *expecting* to be approach by strangers. They're actually *wanting* to meet you. So ditch the fear and get along.

##Follow Up and Create Value

Sharing a beer at a meetup doesn't necessarily open the doors. The best relationships take time.

Follow up on Twitter, LinkedIn or any other applicable platform. Or it might take a bit longer, maybe the next event you meet. But over time relationships develop so don't be disheartened if they don't develop overnight.

A good relationship is built on top of many things but one of the core fundamentals has to be mutually beneficial value for both parties. Don't make it a one way street.

What does value mean? Well value can be many things to many people and is something I will explore in a future post. I strongly believe it doesn't have to be money. Introductions, advice, feedback or even just an ear - there are many ways you can provide value to others. Paying it forward really does work.

Even the most junior and inexperienced members of the tech community have an important opinion and knowledge.
