A bug bear of mine is 'stealth mode'. I can understand why people do it, you come up the next *big thing*, it's a million (maybe even billion) pound idea and it's your baby. So what if someone ridicules it? Even worse, what if someone steals it and makes those millions? 

Best keep it all secret! Well in reality that's flawed thinking.

##Why should I share?

It's never too early to get feedback and the only way to do this is by sharing your idea.

Feedback is tough thing to swallow. It might be good, it might be bad but by exploring ideas with people you'll be challenged, opened up to new ideas or avenues or advised against others.

Filtering the feedback is the hard part, it shouldn't be gaining it. Some of it will be dead wrong and you'll be right to ignore it but other times the feedback will be littered with nuggets of information.

So if feedback is important why dont you share?

##If it's that easy to steal is it worth doing?

One of the most common complaints against haring ideas is 'someone will steal it'. My thoughts on this are pretty simple. If it's that easy to steal is it worth doing?

There's a tonne of reasons for saying this. Most obvious one being that if your idea is that easy to copy then as soon as you come out of stealth mode and launch it will be cloned. And what did you gain - first mover advantage for a week or two? But you lost how long developing the idea?

More than that idea's are worthless, executing is everything. 

Everyone has ideas. From kids in primary school to pensioners in a care home. So what makes you and your ideas different? The key is not the idea or the concept. Customers don't buy them. They buy products.

A product is derived from your execution of an idea. From the design and development through to marketing, sales and customer service. Your ability to take an idea and execute on it is what sets it apart. It's not the concept in of itself as it's pretty much guaranteed someone somewhere will be working on something similar if not better.

This leads to another point - having your idea stolen can be a good thing.

##I would want someone to copy me

![Say whaaaat?](/images/blog/say-what.gif "Say what?")

Yip. I'd want someone to copy me. For a few reasons.

Firstly, someone copying the idea is a real showing of validation. It helps to show there is a market for what you're working. If nobody thought it was a good idea would you really want to be working on it?

With more people working in the same area as you, you will be able to externally observe how they do. You can learn from their mistakes and successes.

Then even if they do copy the idea and execute better then hopefully you would be first in line for acquisition (as talent, for a numbers grab or product expansion) or at worst your experience would make you immediately employable.

##Tear up the NDA and get out there

Only final piece of advice is to tear up the NDA you're carrying about with you. It your idea is that easy yo copy the NDA is worthless nevermind the fact you likely don't have the ability (well capital) to back it up. But more than any of that, to me, it shows a massive level of distrust.

Appreciate your thoughts on this and if you have an idea you want to talk about why not grab a pint with me at the RookieOven Meetup and we can talk it over.
