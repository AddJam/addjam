title: Case Study - Glasgow Walkingha
---
Through 2014 Add Jam have delivered mobile applications for the Glasgow City Council Future City Project. Specifically in the Active Travel workstream. We developed two products - Glasgow Cycling (which we featured in a previous case study) and Glagow Walking.

##Project Aims

The overall aim with the Active Travel Demonstrator in the Future City Project is to develop ways a city can be less reliant on carbon based transit. So ideally by improving the amount of running, cycling and walking.

Walking is one on the lowest impact ways to be active but we all do far too little of it. The idea behind Glasgow Walking is to get the city out and about discovering the hidden gems that are infront of us.

Across the city many organisations (not just the council) produce walks taking into account the history and heritage but the only useful means of distributing this was through paper.

If you've ever travelled you'll know the type of content we're taking about. A palmflet that would normal being on a reception desk or perspex box that's great to pick up and take with you but not without its issues. Printed materials once commited to paper are quickly out of date. Additionally the paper, ink and distribution is hardly economic or environmentally friendly.

So why not use our phones? We can store information offline, its mobile and we more feature rich.

##Glasgow Walking

The Active Travel Demonstrator lead, Mark Irwin, had a few clear requirements with this app, offline functionality and again simplicity. We distilled the exisitng walk data the city had (locked away in those pdfs) into a simple API powered by an 'admin portal' and a gorgeous mobile client.

##Reinventing The Tourist App

If we do say so ourselves Glasgow Walking is a pleasure to use. We added in subtle elements to the UI to enhance the expeience, for example the list of attractions in a walk has an inline compass tell users the distance and direction to the attraction. A simple lightweight addition to the interface but it provides so much value to the user.

These additions in combination with the UI geared towards beautiful photography makes the app stand out in a what can be quite a dry subjet area in mobile apps.

##iOS vs Android 

Functionality wise the app has pretty much parity across iOS and Android. But being a native app (vs web based cross platform) there is a higher level of customisation we can to to ensure the experience is right for their respective platforms.

So for example on iOS we make extensive use 'blur views' in keeping with the iOS look and feel that was introduced in iOS7. The blur view gives a sense of depth with the high res photography underpinning the view. Whereas on Android we use a custom dialog box to display the same data. This is a style that is more fitting on that platform.

Another difference is in sharing, the iOS app was developed before iOS 8 was released and therefore the sharing options are limited to Facebook and Twitter. On Android however we have a share button that uses the Android share sheet to expose more sharing options - really whatever the user has installed.
