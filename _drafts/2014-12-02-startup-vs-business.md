title: We're building a business. Not a startup.
---
Following on from our previous post we wanted to elaborate on our views of the types of business we encountered exhibiting at the Dublin Web Summit.

We’ve defined it as Startups Vs Businesses.

* A startup is a person or a group of people working on a cool concept or idea.
* A business is validated, has expenses and most importantly has paying customers.

We’re doing what we do to make a business. Sure every now and then we’ll produce something without a clear customer in mind (lol2048 anyone?) but we always do it with a business justification. In the case of lol2048 we learned a great deal in regards to running AB tests and experimentations due to the high traffic levels.

We sustain the business through client work and partnerships but this allows us to iterate on product as we aim to achieve product market fit.
