Steve Jobs has many great quotes attributed to him but one of the best is:

```"Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works."```

At Add Jam we bring design into the core of the product development process. 

##Design is more than the aesthetics of a product.

We love our coffee. We've tried all kinds of coffee making contraptions from stove tops and caffetires to V60's but nothing has made consistenyly good coffee as well as the Aeropress.

Which is suprising as the smoked plastic gives a decidely 80's feel to the Aeropress that doesn't instill confidence. Then there's the various plastic accessories that are packed with the product - funnels, spoons and stirrers. It's hardly the last word in simlicity when you first take it out the box. Oh and then there's the box. It really looks like something that was designed for TV infomercials with cheesy slogans and seemingly outrageous claims.

But in truth, for making coffee - the product transends the looks. Consistently you get a great coffee, smooth and with little to no sediment. It's easy to clean and once you get a knack for how all the bits fit together it's really pretty quick.

##How software works

A common mantra in software development is if the end user doesn't care, they only want the end prodcut. This is true to a certian extent. I know my granny doesn't care if something is written in PHP or Ruby. She will care if a product is unresponsive or takes too long to load.

Decisions on implementation *do* have an impact on the end product and how our users experience them. 

Design choices are made in the initial technical planning of a product are very important. The design of the product schema along with how and what you're storing will dictate what you can achieve at product level.

Design really isn't something you sprinkle over the top of software, it also lives within.  

##Skills are tranferable

In life we like to put things into silos so we make software into it's own distinct industry. In truth creating software shares a lot of the concepts and principles of creating products in other industries.

When making a physical product you would look into material selection, distribution, manufacturing process and maintenance/after life. In software it's really not so different we have language/stack selection, hosting, deployment and maintenance/readability.

What we do in software is not unique.
