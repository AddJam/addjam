Apple Watch is nearly upon us. Preorders start on the 10th of April with the watch launched on the 24th. The Add Jam team will be getting watches day one as we feel it's important to embrace new platforms and immerse ourselves in new interaction paradigms.

We already have a host of devices that ensure we're constantly connected, iPhone, iPad, MacBooks and now even our TV's, so what value do we expect the Apple Watch will give? 

##Siri put the kettle on
Home automation is going to be huge. The internet of things is going to have a massive impact our lives in the coming years and nowhere more so than the home.

Having access to our personal assistant, Siri, on our wrists is going to open up new and more accessible ways to interact with our homes. That could be putting the kettle on as you walk downstairs, changing the Hue lighting to set the mood or asking Siri to turn the heating up on a cold winter night.

##There's no such thing as bad weather
The Add Jam team are huge fans of Dark Sky on iOS and the Forecast.io API that powers it - we do live in a very rainy Glasgow after all.

The Dark Sky notification centre widget has been a mainstay on our phones since the introduction of iOS8 and having this on our wrists in glancable form will be massive.

No more being caught short in the rain, hopefully.

##I'm not on day release, honest
Both Chris and I have worn activity trackers over the past few years, myself a Misfit Shine and Chris a Jawbone. Neither of us are currently wearing them. We both do wear a watch, mainly as a fashion statement.

With the Jawbone and especially the Misfit it was all too common to be asked if it was a prisoners tag or toy on your wrist. Not exactly the look we go for.

With the Apple Watch, Apple are clearly trying to address this issue by having an array of strap and material choices. Chris and I are looking at getting a watch that suits out tastes, both unique.

##The ultimate health kick
With the Apple Watch being something we're not ashamed to wear hopefully we'll get more acurate and beneficial health data.

The reminders for when you've been inactive for too long is genius. As developers its all too easy to lose yourself in work and be far too inactive.

Add in more ways to monitor health (heart rate monitoring) and the tight integration with HealthKit (already used by the likes of Withing, MyFitnessPal and Strava). The Apple Watch should give us a clearer picture on how we treat our bodies and what we could be doing to improve.

##Telling the time
It's an obvious one really but it seems to be lost in all the excitement and possibilities of what the Apple Watch can or could (and maybe can't) do. The Apple Watch opens new possibilities on how we tell the time.

Apple has already demoed how configurable the watch face will be. Do you want to see the phase of the moon or maybe the time for sunrise. It's a personal experience we haven't really been able to do on a watch before.

So what do you want from the Apple Watch? Or maybe its the Pebble Time you think is the future of wrist worn wearable? Maybe neither. Appreciate your thoughts on this as we look to make products in this area.
