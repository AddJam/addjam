Apple Watch is nearly upon us. Preorders start on the 10th of April with the watch launched on the 24th. The Add Jam team can't wait to get the device and we've been talking about possible use cases and scenarios the watch will come in handy. Here are our top 5 apps we're looking forward to using on the Apple Watch.

##There's no such thing as bad weather
The Add Jam team are huge fans of Dark Sky on iOS and the Forecast.io API that powers it - we do live in a very rainy Glasgow after all.

The Dark Sky notification centre widget has been a mainstay on our phones since the introduction of iOS8 and having this on our wrists in glancable form will be massive.

No more being caught short in the rain, hopefully.

##Check me in Scotty
We're big fans of Swarm (formerly known as Foursquare). Checking into restrants and bars gives visibility to nearby friends giving the chance for impormptu meetups.

But the biggest value is it builds up the Foursquare database which is an incredible way to uncover new places even in your home city. Knowning where the locals go is the best way to find the best places to go in a city. So we really like the Foursquare ethos and try our best to check into places we frequent and like.

Problem is remembering to do it. This could be solved with a glance.

##Paying with a flick of the wrist
Apple Pay is yet to come to Scotland on the iPhone let alone the Watch but we expect the watch to give the painless, simple payments the future has been promising us.

A lot of people will be thinking 'big deal' but a simple use case hit home the power of this feature.

Taking a trip across our native Glasgow you would use Scotrail for the railways, FirstBus for the buses and SPT for the subway. There's no cohesive payment option across the board - train vending machine don't take cash, buses only take cash and the subway now has their own smart card implmentation. Surely this could be easier unified under a flick of the wrist. 

Or even look at London you have the Oyster Card, undoubtedly a big step over what we have in Glasgow, but you still need to reach for a card in your wallet. Yeah it's a first world problem, but it's still a problem if you're travelling with kids or have a handful of shopping bags. Waving your watch over the payment terminal is more natural, quicker, easier and more convienient.
