title: Helping us get stuff done
---
Over the past year we've worked hard at finding services that complement our ways of working, are effective and stick. It's common knowledge that services can have all the functionality in the world but if they don't fit into a workflow or way of working it's wasted effort. Here's a summary of the key services we use as a team.

##Slack
The number one tool for Add Jam without a doubt is the excellent Slack. I was skeptical at first, we had tried to adoopt similar services in the past (gitter which integrates with Github was a good example) but Slack stuck.

It's our central communications hub across the team and we hook up other services into this so we have visibility of deploys, tests, commits and more.

##GitHub

Remote repositories right? Well yeah, but it's also so much more. 

We use Github for our open source projects and the social aspect allows us to make pull requests or have them done on our code. Most developers will have at least a free account and can join in with us.

We also use GitHub pages to host simple single page projects where applicable (see LoL2048). It's free and robust, being on the GitHub infrastructure allowed us to handle the massive traffic LoL2048 recieved on day one.

A really handy feature we use on GitHub is Wiki's. This serves as an internal knowledge base. Here we keep a log of devices available to Add Jam, services we use and why, a reading list and a place to keep company copy and logos. All basic information but to have it centralised and accessible is really vaulable to the team as is (Chris and I) but will become even more useful as Add Jam expands.

##Trello

Project Management tools are two a penny and so many organisations have a preference for their own service. We find Trello the best for Add Jam.

It's free, easy to understand, has a mobile client and integrates with Slack. Most importantly the Kanban style of moving cards suits our workflow.

We have project level boards for each project (client or internal product) and we have a company level 'Master Board'. This is without doubt the most useful board for Add Jam.

Here we list goals and tasks for 'This Week', 'This Month', '6 Months' and '12 Months'. We always want to see progression of tasks that will help us reach those 12 month goals.

We also have an 'Icebox' where we stick ideas and projects that would be good to do \*someday\*. It allows us to say 'no' and keep focus on whats on the board.

##Dropbox

It's the best in the game at the moment. We have Google Drive, One Drive, iCloud Drive and Box accounts but Dropbox just 'fits' for Add Jam.

We don't sync much through it (we try to share important and finalised files through Slack) but it's handy for three main areas of work:

* Sharing work-in-progress files - things like Sketch Designs are best shared through Dropbox and saves a versioning mess and email ping pong.
* Sharing Paw files - we use the incredibly useful Paw for testing endpoints and making requests. Dropbox is the best way to keep these constantly changing paw files.
* Sharing with clients. Being around the longest and known to most, Dropbox is by far the easiest way to share files and assets with Clients who aren't in a Slack channel

##Summary

Our biggest piece of advice is do what works for you - experiment and give it a shot. But also it should be no suprise the services we use are market leaders and well established in their fields. What works for you will likely also work for others.

With that in mind, hopefully the above will shine some light on how Add Jam works and help improve your work flow.
