##Look broader, look closer

Add Jam were fortunate enough to see Tony speak at the 2014 Web Summit in Dublin. We find Tony to be one of those speakers who has such passion and excitement in what he does you can't fail to hang on every word of his.

We often find ourselves watching talks and interviews with him and  we try to pull his teachings into what we do as product developers in Add Jam.
