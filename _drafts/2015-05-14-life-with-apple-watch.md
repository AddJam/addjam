19th of April 2015, the Add Jam team get our of their respective beds, bleary eyed stumble to get a coffee then camp out at their laptops to order the Apple Watch. Success! Two 42mm Stainless Steel Apple Watches ordered for the opening delivery window.

So we've now had out devices for a few weeks. Here's how we've found life with the Apple Watch.

##Checking in

One of the most evident benefits of Apple Watch has been Passbook on your wrist. Fitting that two days aftern my Apple Watch was delivered both Chris and I set off for a short breaks. Chris to London and myself to Rome. 

We both had different experiences using our watches for Passbook. I found myself too ashamed to use the watch, the newness of the form factor made me slef concious. Chris on the other hand, being the braver of us, proudly put faith in his watch and used it for getting through security.

He hit a stumbling block when it came to boarding. Firstly the scanner at the gate was was behind a counter but the biggest deal breaker was the design. It had a cover over the top meaning not even Chris' skinny wrists could fit under it. 

##Getting around

Initially the concept of maps on your wrist was wasted on me. Surely nobody would want to use a postage stamp size screen on their wrist for maps when they have their phone on them. How wrong I was.

Again while on my break to Rome; I found navigating the tight cobbled streets of the city to be a breeze with maps on Apple Watch. Setting a destination on my phone I was given a gentle tap when I came to a turn and a nice bit easy to understand arrow on my wrist. I'm now a Apple Watch navigation convert.

##Being a typical Scot

One thing Scottish people will always talk about is weather. Its understanable really, in Glasgow we can easily have 4 seasons in an hour let alone a day. So having glanceable weather information my watch face complication is massively useful.

Taking it a step further, I've have Dark Sky on my Apple Watch. The app has a glance - quickly accisible information with a swipe up. However, in a common fault with all glances, it takes so long for the little information the glance shows to load I'm usually quicker firing up the app.

The Dark Sky app is gorgeous. A nice animation at the top to dipicte the weather and detailed information accessible with a scroll of the digital crown. The granular weather data is as spot on as ever and really at home on the wrist.

##Being active

We're busy and largely inactive people. It's part of the job of being the founder of a tech startup. We're sat infront of our MacBooks for hours on end each day.

The hourly reminders to try stand at least once an hour have been beneficial on a few levels. Firstly I do believe it will have a positive impact on my health but Chris and I are also using it as a way to once an hour get up and away from the code. We talk about our problems and plans. We even use it as an excuse to fit in a game of pool.

It breaks up the day, gets us out our own heads and I think has a benenficial impact on productivity.

##Communication

The Apple Watch comes packed with a multitude of means to communicate. Sketchs, taps and heartbeats have been demoed repeatidly but none of them are of much genuine use.

Instead I've found one of Apple's biggest let downs in the past few years to excel on Apple Watch - Siri. Dictation and voice recognition (even with our Glaswegian accents) has been near flawless. A far cry from the Siri of 2011.

With dictation being so accurate I've found mself dicating messages quite often on my watch whereas on iPhone and iPad it's a feature I've never used.
