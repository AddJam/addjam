title: Looking Back, Moving Forward
---
It's safe to say 2014 was huge for Michael and I. 12 months ago we were both in employment and now, at the beginning of 2015, weâ€™re founders of Add Jam which is looking to grow and prosper throughout the year.

##The Beginning
As I said, at the start of 2014 both Michael and I were in employment, Michael with Strathclyde University and I was working at Kana. Far from the worst jobs in the world but we both felt constrained and behind on our learning and development. We were in a position where we were working full time and every evening and at weekends we were getting together to work on concepts and ideas.

Then in January Add Jam was born... well kind of. Michael and I had been working a concept of an intelligent travel guide we were calling Scout. It was an iOS app (rails back end) where users would submit their holiday destination and we would return a simple high level overview of the location. Concurrently we had been talking to Scott Sherwood from the Technology Strategy Board Future City Project in Glasgow about joining the team. We pitched and were awarded contracts to deliver mobile applications on the Active Travel Demonstrator and thus the seeds of Add Jam were planted.

##Executing

Through 2014 the Future City Project was our main focus and source of income. We designed and developed 2 distinct products - Glasgow Walking and Glasgow Cycling (you can read more about these on our [Client Case Studies section](/client-case-studies/ "Add Jam Client Projects")) - which were delivered using 6 separate code bases (2 Rails backends, 2 native iOS client and 2 native Android clients). It was a huge undertaking for a team of two but we truly feel we excelled in the project.

But out with the Future City Project Michael and I continued to work on other concepts and with more direction and drive than ever before. We were particularly interested in achieving a source of near passive income for the business and we identified eSports as an area filled with opportunities ripe for exploitation. To this end I started to curate the weekly League of Legends newsletter and we developed a network of complimentary products and services. The highest profile of these without doubt is LoL2048.

Like most of the internet between March and April of 2014 we were both obsessed with getting 2048 in the puzzle game by Gabriele Cirulli. The code for the project was opened sourced and we saw the opportunity of creating a League of Legends themed variant. It went huge. Over 2 million uniques, 20 million games played and 1000 newsletter signups.

As well as experimenting with ways to drive traffic and signups to our League of Legends network we started to explore what 'we' as a company should be. Obviously the end product is Add Jam and I think this leads to a key takeaway from my experiences over the past year. We got on with doing. We made money, we made mistake, we progressed. It wasn't until October that Add Jam had a website and brand identity but in the preceding 10 months we hadn't been idle. Progress beats perfection every time.

##Moving forward

So what will Add Jam be doing in 2015?

First on our list is to establish an office and working environment that will allow Add Jam to prosper. We think the path to achieving this lies with one of Michaels projects over the last few years, RookieOven. Michael has been working for years on establishing a better tech community in Scotland by blogging and running events, in 2015 this will move to a physical location with a dedicated space for the tech community of Glasgow.

We feel that by being surrounded by the best of our local community will act as a driving force for us to achieve more and be better when creating our products. We do not want to be the smarted people in the room, if you are it leaves you open to complacency.

Add Jam will also continue to smash it out the park with client projects. Going forward we are going to be even more selective about who we work with. We want to be exclusively working on projects that excite us and give us the freedom to bring our skills in product development to the fore.
