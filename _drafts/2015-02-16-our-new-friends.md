It can be a lonely game being a founder. Even in a two man team like Add Jam it's hard to have the water cooler moments or interact with different personalities. That's one of the biggest reasons why we're joining a new coworking space for tech companies in our home city of Glasgow.

The space is in the stunning [Fairfield Shipyard in Govan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfield_Offices). Once the [biggest shipyard on the Clyde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfield_Shipbuilding_and_Engineering_Company) and the heart of the Glasgow shipbuilding industry. The very building we will be in was once the drawing offices and a hub of Victorian innovation. It's all coming full circle with our new friends:

##[Lighthouse Labs](http://lighthouselabs.co.uk)

Location aware apps are nothing new - Dodgeball (the predecessor to Foursquare) started in 2000 - but iBeacons, they're something new and very powerful both for us users and for companies.

Fine grain indoor positioning has huge potential, wether that be speeding up the ordering/collection process at store when doing click and collect or when it comes to finding children lost in a shopping centre.

Lighthouse are developing a platform to empower developers to take full advantage of iBeacons. The team are split between London and Glasgow with Daniel McAfferty being base in the office with us.

##You?

There's more desk space available and if you're interested in joining the community get in touch with me (either [email](mailto:michael@addjam.com) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/_mdhayes) are best) and I can show you round some time.

We'll write up some more about the space and how it develops in the coming months. It's really something made by the community, for the community to make Glasgow a better place to base your tech business. It's going to need steer for you guys.
