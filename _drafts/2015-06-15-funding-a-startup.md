Starting your own business is daunting. One of the biggest concerns a founder has is how to fund it all. Even in tech today with $5 per month Digital Ocean VPS, free internet access and amazing open source tools and frameworks giving a ridiculously low barrier to entry you still have costs and you still need to live.

So how do you do it? While by no means experts we thought it would be worth sharing the Add Jam approach to this.

##Hand outs and the like

At least locally in Glasgow/Scotland local and national government support young businesses through a raft of schemes and progammes - Business Gateway, Scottish Enterprise, Interactive Scotland, Creative Clyde etc etc.

The help comes in a lot of shapes and sizes - some of it outstanding like EIE by Informatics Ventures, others... not so good. One of the forms of help is grants.

Grants have been put to us as 'free money' (incidently by those 'giving' it out) but we don't agree on this approach. It's not free money, it's tax payers money. We see so many startups where the founders are basically full time grand application writers - no sales, no product development.

Match funding, favourable loans and salary contributions are better as there's some onus on the company to pay something. Grants lack a 'commercial' edge and leave a bad taste in the mouth.

##To raise, or not to raise

##Summary

sum up, its just Add jams experience and approach. It suits our business and it fits our mantra and products. Some need more capital. Do whats right but think about it.
