		<h2>What Add jam does</h2>

		<p>
			With our highly skilled and capable team we develop products for mobile (and occasianally the web). We believe in using the right tool for the job to ensure a at the end of the product development journey we have the right product for customers. In doing so we use a range of technologies such as Swift, Objective-C and Java to make the high quality products that people will love.
		</p>

		<p>
			At Add Jam we also love contributing to the open source community. We publish our open source projects on our GitHub page and on our blog we provide posts to help others integrate them into their work (we love hearing how).

		<h2>Open and Transparent</h2>

		<p>
			We try to be as open as possible. Therefore we proudly display the key metrics of our products for all to see on our dashboard. We believe in being as proud in your failures as much as you would be your successes, both take pride of place on the dashboard.
		</p>

		<p>
			We also share our business journey on our blog. Our aim here is to share our experiences of developing Add Jam as a business, discuss our internal processes, advise on the techniques we use and share the outputs of the experiemnts we run to obtain growth in our products. The blog will also be home to technical pieces such as we structure our products and tools used in the product development process.
